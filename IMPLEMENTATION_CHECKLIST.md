**Status**: Not started - repository is working tool, not marketed

---

## Migration & Modernization

**Goal**: Consider modern alternatives while maintaining bash compatibility.

### Long-term Considerations

- [ ] Evaluate Python rewrite for complex scripts (csf_ban_wp_login_attackers)
- [ ] Consider containerization (Docker) for portable testing
- [ ] Evaluate cloud-native alternatives (AWS WAF, Cloudflare)
- [ ] Research eBPF-based alternatives to IPSET
- [ ] Consider systemd integration for service scripts

**Status**: Deferred - bash scripts work well for target use cases

---

## Current Priority Focus

1. **Immediate**: Run shellcheck and fix critical issues
2. **Short-term**: Add basic tests for csf_ban_wp_login_attackers
3. **Medium-term**: Create usage examples wiki
4. **Long-term**: Evaluate new script additions based on user feedback
