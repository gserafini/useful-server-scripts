Gabriel's Useful Server Scripts
=====================

Useful scripts for server administration

** svn_add_remove **
Run this script in a directory you are managing using svn. It will ask you if you would like
to svn add new files and svn remove missing files.  It is particularly useful if a 
WordPress installation has been automatically upgraded and files have been added / removed
that you would like to then check in.
